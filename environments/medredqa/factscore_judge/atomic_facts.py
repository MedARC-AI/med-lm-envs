    query = "Thank you for sharing your concerns. Its good that you are paying attention to your health and planning to see a doctor. Let me help explain a few things to hopefully ease your worries and guide you on what to do next.\n\n**1. Feeling a pulsation in the abdomen:**\n- It is actually not uncommon for some people, especially young and thin individuals, to feel or even see the pulsation of their abdominal aorta, especially when lying down. This is because the abdominal aorta is a large artery close to the surface in the abdomen.\n- However, you mentioned you are overweight, which can sometimes make feeling the aorta less likely, but its still possible depending on body shape, how your abdominal muscles are, and your heart rate.\n\n**2. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA):**\n- AAA is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta that usually occurs in older adults, especially men over 65, smokers, or those with a family history.\n- It is very rare in young people like you (16 years old).\n- AAA usually does not cause pain or visible pulsations until it becomes large or ruptures, which is a medical emergency.\n- Mild, brief abdominal pain and sensations you describe are unlikely to be caused by AAA, especially given your age.\n\n**3. High blood pressure and lifestyle:**\n- High blood pressure at your age should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. It can sometimes be related to lifestyle factors but also may have other causes.\n- Lifestyle changes like healthier eating, exercise, and weight loss are great steps to improve your blood pressure and overall health.\n\n**4. What you should do next:**\n- Its important to see a healthcare provider to get a proper physical exam and possibly some tests (like blood pressure monitoring, abdominal ultrasound if needed).\n- An abdominal ultrasound is a painless, non-invasive way to check for an aneurysm and other abdominal issues. Its a straightforward test that your doctor can order if they think its necessary.\n- Let your parents or guardians know about your symptoms and concerns so they can help you get medical evaluation.\n\n**5. Managing anxiety:**\n- Feeling anxious about health is common, especially when you notice unusual symptoms.\n- Try to focus on facts: AAA is very unlikely at your age.\n- Continue healthy habits and keep track of symptoms.\n- If anxiety feels overwhelming, consider discussing this with your doctor as well.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Feeling your abdominal pulse can be normal and does not automatically mean you have an aneurysm.\n- AAA is very rare at your age.\n- Mild abdominal pain and sensations are unlikely related to aneurysm.\n- You should see a healthcare provider for evaluation and blood pressure management.\n- An abdominal ultrasound can be done if needed to reassure you.\n- Keep up with healthy lifestyle changes and try to manage anxiety.\n\nIf you experience sudden severe abdominal or back pain, dizziness, or fainting, seek emergency medical care immediately.\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps you feel more informed and less worried. Seeing a doctor soon will give you peace of mind and ensure your health is on the right track. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
    query2 = "This topic can be a little sensitive. Without knowing more of your background, I'd advise going to the doctor to differentiate a UTI from an STI or some other infection or other cutaneous condition like bacterial vaginosis. STIs in particular can progress to pelvic inflammatory disease which has the potential to cause you significant long term issues as well as discomfort. Ultimately, if it is a UTI, it might go away on its own or it might not. The risk is yours to take. Is there any particular reason you don't want to go to a doctor? The basic tests that they might consider ordering (e.g. swabs, urine sample) can often be self-collected. They may recommend a visual inspection +\/- examination of the area. You can very reasonably ask for a female doctor or specialised nurse at any point."
